      <p> Kalam was the youngest of five siblings and was noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle.A well-known scientist associated with Kalam, Dr Raghunath Mashelkar, told media after his death:<i>"The very first meeting touched me, because I saw a man who was simple, very humane and yet professional at the same time. I saw evidence of his extraordinary humility and willingness to learn from others in another instance."</i></p>
       <p> Kalam was a great motivator too. His words, <i>"Look at the sky. We are not alone. The whole universe is friendly to us and conspires only to give the best to those who dream and work" </i>persuades students to think high and dream big.

        <ul>
          <li>Wings of Fire</li>
          <li> Ignited Minds </li>
          <li> India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Kalam's vision was to transform the nation into a developed country from developing one.
        His contibutions to the scientific world brought glory to the country. Some of his contributions are: </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Development of Agni and Prithvi</li>

        <li>Invention of Kalam-Raju - a tablet to monitor health of underprivileged people in rural India are  few of his great contributions.
        </li></ul>

       <p> Kalam was awarded India's highest civilian honour, Bharat Ratna,for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India.
        The death of this prolific personality was a loss not just to the scientific community, but to the country as a whole.</p>
